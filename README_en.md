# Hiragana IME for IBus

**Hiragana IME** is a Japanese input method that makes it easier to input plain Japanese sentences. With previous input methods, people often wrote sentences with difficult kanji characters. Many found themselves using kanji they couldn't even read.

The kanji dictionary in **Hiragana IME** is assembled using only the kanji characters from the Jōyō Kanji list, excluding names of people and places. If necessary, you can also select a kanji dictionary that includes only the kanji characters you've learned so far at school.

In **Hiragana IME**, the steps for inputting characters and converting them to kanji are separate. As you type on the keyboard, characters are entered as hiragana-only sentences without automatic kanji conversion. If you want to use kanji, you can easily replace hiragana characters anywhere in the text with kanji. There's no need to convert hiragana into kanji while typing.

Additionally, when using the [Furigana Pad](https://github.com/esrille/furiganapad) with **Hiragana IME**, you can automatically add Furigana, or readings, to the inputted kanji. Not everyone can easily read kanji due to dyslexia and other reasons. Digital Japanese textbooks now include Furigana for Japanese schoolchildren. Looking ahead, it is crucial to transform our society into one where the inability to read kanji doesn't prevent anyone from being happy.
